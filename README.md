# Packages
Repository for Package Management of Zeneyra Linux

**NOTE: This isn't the server repository that stores all the built packages for Kagero, but is the repository to manage and discuss about the packages that will go into the official Orochi repositories for Kagero!**

## Orochi Repositories
Similar how Arch Linux has core, extra, community and multilib as its Pacman repositories, Zeneyra Linux has multiple repositories to sort all the packages and also allow other software or distros that use libkagero or Kagero to directly use Zeneyra's repositories.  
All repositories feature a `-nightly` package to install the nightly version of a software if needed.
